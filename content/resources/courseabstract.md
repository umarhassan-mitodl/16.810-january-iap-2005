  course in the Department of Aeronautics and

  Astronautics at MIT. This course combines design theory, lectures and hands-on activities
  to teach the

  design stages from conception to implementation. Activities include hand sketching,
  CAD, CAE, CAM,

  design optimization, rapid prototyping, and structural testing. The learning objectives,
  pedagogy, required resources and instructional processes as well as results from
  a student assessment are discussed.'
